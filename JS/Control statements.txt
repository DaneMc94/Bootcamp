Write a JavaScript program that accepts three numbers and prints "All numbers are equal" if all three numbers are equal, "All numbers are different" if all three numbers are different and "Neither all are equal or different" otherwise.

Test Data:

Input first number: 2
Input second number: 3
Input third number: 4

Expected Output :

All numbers are different.

// allowing user to enter the 3 numbers
let a = prompt("Enter the first number");
let b = prompt("Enter the second number");
let c = prompt("Enter the third number");

// check if numbers are all equal
if (a == b && a == c) {
  document.write("All numbers are equal");
}
// check if numbers are all different
else if (a != b && b != c && a != c) {
  document.write("All numbers are different");
}
// statement if neither condition is met
else {
  document.write("Neither all are equal or different");
}
